### vImageExample
Sample project converting frames captured by camera to vImage buffer.

### Work in Progress:
At the moment output colors are not correct <br />
Memory management and errors are not considered <br />
Output buffer is temporarily converted to `UIImage`

### UPDATE:
Problem with color palette has been fixed 🎉🤘🏼
